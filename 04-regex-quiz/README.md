todays kata was an exploration into REGEX - here was the instruction:

https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-validation-of-a-username-with-regex

Write a simple regex to validate a username.

Allowed characters are:

-lowercase letters -numbers -underscore

length shoould be between 4 and 16 characters.

our tests passed after getting our heads around REGEX for a bit. view solutions.js to check out what we came up with. Our group whiteboard markup is included in this directory as a jpeg.

Thank you!
