code wars kata day three - solved with Dre!

You're at the zoo... all the meerkats look weird. Something has gone terribly wrong - someone has gone and switched their heads and tails around!

Save the animals by switching them back. You will be given an array which will have three values (tail, body, head). It is your job to re-arrange the array so that the animal is the right way round (head, body, tail).

Same goes for all the other arrays/lists that you will get in the tests: you have to change the element positions with the same exact logics - simples!


my solution:

All of our tests passed with just reversing the input, which was a perfect use of the reverse(); array method in javascript. If the inputs were more complex or in a more shuffled order, this code challenge would have been a lot more difficult. The instructions were to simply turn the animals around.
