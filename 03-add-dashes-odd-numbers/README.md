problem:

Write a function insertDash(num)/InsertDash(int num) that will insert dashes ('-') between each two odd numbers in num. For example: if num is 454793 the output should be 4547-9-3. Don't count zero as an odd number.

I have two slightly different solutions in solution.js - they both basically accomplish the same thing with the same logic, just a slightly different order. I couldn't seem to decide on which one was better.
