Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.

The output should be two capital letters with a dot seperating them.

It should look like this:

Sam Harris => S.H

Patrick Feeney => P.F

I crafted a Solution to solve this. view solution.js in this repo to see my solution. The image file in this repo is my pseudocode.
